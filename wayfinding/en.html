        <h2>Wayfinding Evaluation in Virtual Environments</h2>

<p>The following study is part of the research work within the master's thesis "Multiplatform Tool for Comparative Wayfinding Evaluation in Virtual Ambients" by Leonardo Bareño, under the supervision of Dr. Pablo Figueroa, Systems and Computer Engineering Department, Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia).</p>
		
<h3>Purpose of Study</h3>

<p>Compare the user behavior between combinations of several implementations (Web and Quest), and locomotion techniques. Users will have a chance to explore a challenging virtual environment, while appreciating 3D models of Colombian prehispanic artifacts.</p>

<h3>Web Modality</h3>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Laptop or desktop computer (Windows, Mac).</li>
  <li>Internet connection during the test execution.</li>
  <li>Users must not have participated in neither of the other instances of the study (Quest or Web). Due to purposes related to assessment of spatial learning, it is necessary that users do not have prior knowledge of the virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recommended:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using a conventional mouse.</li>
  <li>Chrome or Firefox browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quest Modality</h3>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>An Oculus Quest device.</li>
  <li>Have both Touch controllers (left and right) turned on.</li>
  <li>Internet connection during the test execution.</li>
  <li>Users must not have participated in neither of the other instances of the study (Quest or Web). Due to purposes related to assessment of spatial learning, it is necessary that users do not have prior knowledgment of the virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quest - Installation Instructions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Download the APK file from the address provided in the confirmation email.</li>
  <li>Install Sidequest on your PC from <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/">https://sidequestvr.com/</a>, this software will be used for moving the APK file from your computer to the Quest device. If you have not formerly install contents from your computer to the Quest device, you could require to install the Oculus ADB Driver (<a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/">https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/</a>) and apply Developer Mode settings to your Quest (more info at <a href=" https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/?device=QUEST"> https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/?device=QUEST</a>). These steps are better explained at a tutorial <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Physical layout: You can keep Quest Guardian settings in stationary mode. Locomotion in real world will be not required, however some real view rotations could be needed in order to look behind or around.</li>
  <li>Inside your Quest device, you can find the test application in the "Unknown Sources" list from the App Library, named as WayfindingQuest.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to participate</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Send email to contact.lb.apps at gmail.com , mentioning which modality you want to participate (Quest or Web). A confirmation email will be sent to you, containing a participant ID number and access instructions.</li>
  <li>Inside the application: Enter the ID number, perform the tutorial and then the test itself. It will be finished when 5 objects have been found or 10 minutes have passed, whichever happens first.</li>
  <li>At the end of the test, information will be provided so you can fulfill a questionnaire from your PC or mobile.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of any question or problem, do not hesitate to contact at the email address referred above.</p>

<h3>Raffle</h3>
<p>On May 27, 2021, users who meet the conditions will participate in the raffle for a USD $50 Amazon Gift Card.</p>
<h4>Conditions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Only users who have completed the test and answered the post-questionnaire will participate.</li>
  <li>The raffle will be held if a minimum of 20 users who have tried the application is reached.</li>
  <li>The winner will be defined with the following formula: (<em>LotteryNumber</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modulo_operation&oldid=1015995519">mod</a> <em>UsersNumber</em>) + 1 == <em>UserID</em>, where <em>LotteryNumber</em> are the first 4 numbers (without including the remaining 3-digit "serie" number) from the jackpot prize of <a href="https://loteriadelmeta.gov.co/resultados">draw # 3039, Lotería del Meta</a> that will be held on May 26, 2021, <em>UsersNumber</em> is the final number of users that has been reached on the closing date of the test period, and <em>UserID</em> is the assigned participant ID number. In the event that with the formula the number of a user who has not met the conditions is obtained, the prize will be delivered to the next user in the consecutive order that does meet them.</li>
  <li>The Gift Card will be sent to the winner via email in the currency and country of her choice, as long as they are supported by Amazon.</li>
</ul>
		
<h3>Informed Consent</h3>

<p>By fulfilling the forms and using the test applications, you accept to participate in the study and consent to transmit the gathered data (character pose tracking and events inside the virtual environment). Sensible information such as names or email addresses will NOT be shared or used en any type of communication. For purposes of oral o written communications, experiment performance results will only be used.</p>

<p>By using the Quest application modality, you  declare to be informed about health and safety warnings issued by the hardware manufacturer at <a href="https://securecdn.oculus.com/sr/oculusquest-warning-english">https://securecdn.oculus.com/sr/oculusquest-warning-english</a></p>
