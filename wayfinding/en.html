        <h2>Wayfinding Evaluation in Virtual Environments</h2>

<h3>Purpose of Study</h3>

<p>Compare the user behavior between combinations of several implementations (Web and Quest), and locomotion techniques. Users will have a chance to explore a challenging virtual environment, while appreciating 3D models of Colombian prehispanic artifacts.</p>

<h3>Web Modality</h3>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Laptop or desktop computer (Windows, Mac).</li>
  <li>Internet connection during the test execution.</li>
  <li>Users must not have participated in neither of the other instances of the study (Quest or Web). Due to purposes related to assessment of spatial learning, it is necessary that users do not have prior knowledgment of the virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recommended:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Using a conventional mouse.</li>
  <li>Chrome or Firefox browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quest Modality</h3>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>An Oculus Quest device.</li>
  <li>Internet connection during the test execution.</li>
  <li>Users must not have participated in neither of the other instances of the study (Quest or Web). Due to purposes related to assessment of spatial learning, it is necessary that users do not have prior knowledgment of the virtual environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Quest - Installation Instructions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Download the APK file from the address provided in the confirmation email.</li>
  <li>Install Sidequest on your PC from <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/">https://sidequestvr.com/</a>, this software will be used for moving the APK file from your computer to the Quest device. If you have not formerly install contents from your computer to the Quest device, you could require to install the Oculus ADB Driver (<a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/">https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/</a>) and apply Developer Mode settings to your Quest (more info at <a href=" https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/?device=QUEST"> https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/?device=QUEST</a>). These steps are better explained at a tutorial <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-apps-oculus-quest">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Physical layout: You can keep Quest Guardian settings in stationary mode. Locomotion in real world will be not required, however some real view rotations could be needed in order to look behind or around.</li>
  <li>Inside your Quest device, you can find the test application in the "Unknown Sources" list from the App Library, named as WayfindingQuest.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps to participate</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Send email to contact.lb.apps at gmail.com, mentioning which modality you want to participate (Quest or Web). A confirmation email will be sent to you, containing a participant ID number and access instructions.</li>
  <li>Inside the application: Enter the ID number, perform the tutorial and then the test itself. It will be finished when 5 objects have been found or 10 minutes have passed, whichever happens first.</li>
  <li>At the end of the test, information will be provided so you can fulfill a questionnaire from your PC or mobile.</li>
</ol>
<p>In case of any question or problem, do not hesitate to contact at the email address referred above.</p>
		
		<h3>Informed Consent</h3>

<p>By fulfilling the forms and using the test applications, you accept to participate in the study and consent to transmit the gathered data (character pose tracking and events inside the virtual environment). Sensible information such as names or email addresses will NOT be shared or used en any type of communication. For purposes of oral o written communications, experiment performance results will only be used.</p>

<p>By using the Quest application modality, you  declare to be informed about health and safety warnings issued by the hardware manufacturer at <a href="https://securecdn.oculus.com/sr/oculusquest-warning-english">https://securecdn.oculus.com/sr/oculusquest-warning-english</a></p>
